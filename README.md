# Flutter Codelabs.

This is my attempt at following the Flutter Documentation to create a Flutter App. This is my First Codelab. This app generates a list of StartUp Names for you from the Flutter English packages.

### What I have Learnt.

- How to get add packages to my app.
- Difference between Stateless and Stateful Widgets.

### To Run the Application:

- Clone ther repository.
- Ensure you have Flutter Installed.
- Navigate to the location to which you cloned the repository.
- Open the cloned repository using your terminal.
- Start an Android emulator.
- Run `flutter run`.

`It's all Widgets.`
Happy Coding!
